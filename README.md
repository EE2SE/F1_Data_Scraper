# F1 Model

**For personal educational purposes only**

---

## Problem Statement

With what sort of success and certainty levels can the F1 race results be predicted?
The prediction in the first instance will be made knowing the qualifying results. At the time of writing this there is no empiric or heuristic evidence that this should be better or easier. Gut feel and intuition say it ought to be easier?

## Approach To Understanding the Problem

This problem, while it will involve learning a bunch of new skills, will follow like any other project a systemic route. PACE framework learned in Google's data analytics program will be adopted. For more reference feel free to read a [good summary of PACE framework](https://medium.com/p/12206e1ea536).


### Plan

1. Data
    - The data should at first be fully inclusive from the beginning of F1 existence.
    - The data may later be trimmed or otherwise selectively discarded following EDA.
    - Data shall be acquired from an external source such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020)
    - Data shall be analysed and missing fields shall be filled in, and missing features should be added. E.g., it is known that weather information is missing. 
    - Data shall be stored on a relational database for ease of manipulation.
2. Stakeholder
    - I am mainly doing this for myself. I will be the accuser, the defendant, the jury and the judge in this court room :)
    - Not discarding the chance for a potential future employer or colleague to view this repository. Their holding stake in this project is the visibility and understanding of the process, as opposed to the final result.
3. Timeline
    - No strict timelines. Given some early investigatory work, I estimate between 20 and 40h of total work. Time depends on the extent of model building and results of EDA. My knowledge/ignorance permitting, project should aim to be as comprehensive as it takes to be of a great research standard.
