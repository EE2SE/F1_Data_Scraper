# F1 Model

**For personal educational purposes only**

## Problem Statement

With what sort of success and certainty levels can the F1 race results be predicted?
The prediction in the first instance will be made knowing the qualifying results. At the time of writing this there is no empiric or heuristic evidence that this should be better or easier. Gut feel and intuition say it ought to be easier?

## Approach To Understanding the Problem

This problem, while it will involve learning a bunch of new skills, will follow like any other project a systemic route. PACE framework learned in Google's data analytics program will be adopted.
